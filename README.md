# RoomNumbers

Problem Statement:

You are going to stick the number of your room on the door. The shop near your house suggests wonderful sets of plastic digits. Each set contains exactly ten digits - one of each digit between 0 and 9, inclusive. Return the number of sets required to write your room number. Note that 6 can be used as 9 and vice versa.

Examples:

122
Returns: 2
Two sets are required because each set contains only one '2' digit.

9999
Returns: 2
Each set contains one '6' digit and one '9' digit. '6' could be used as
'9' and therefore two sets are enough.

12635
Returns: 1

888888
Returns: 6
